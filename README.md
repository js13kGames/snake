Snake
===

I've wanted to play around with canvas for a while, and finally I've started!

For a beginning, I've decided to create a Snake game.

I'm using browserify to organize my files and will try my best.

Currently in development.

To develop using it, run server.js to have a local static web server,
and `node build.js`. This build file will watch for changes and automatically
rebuild the bundle.js file.
