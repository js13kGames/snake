Snake
===

I've wanted to play around with canvas for a while, and finally I've started!

For a beginning, I've decided to create a Snake game.

I'm using browserify to organize my files and will try my best.

To develop using it, run server.js to have a local static web server,
and `node build.js`. This build file will watch for changes and automatically
rebuild the bundle.js file.

The game is finished and has some little graphical bugs, but it's good enough
as it is! It's even fun to play with :-)
